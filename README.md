# Welcome to my Data Portfolio

Here you'll be able to discover **Data Studies using various tools.** With this project I've tried to keep it simple - all in one repository showcasing my best of skills in as little files as possible. \
So have a seat and dive deep into the world of numbers. \
Thanks!

## 📁 [Excel Dashboard](https://github.com/nadyakant/data-project/blob/main/Shark%20Attacks_Dash.xlsx) 📁

This Dashboard explores data on **shark attacks worldwide between 1919 and 2020**, including fatality rate, the sum of cases by year, type of attack, and frequency of occurrence. \
It is based on Brenda Griffith's [Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/global-shark-attack-incidents?select=GSAF5.xls.csv) on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/).

## 📁 [HTML](https://github.com/nadyakant/data-project/blob/main/Death%20by%20Sharks%20-%20HTML.html) 📁 and 📁 [JavaScript](https://github.com/nadyakant/data-project/blob/main/Death%20by%20Sharks%20-%20JS.js) 📁 Dashboard 

This Visualization dives a little deeper into the **fatal cases of shark attacks around the world**, including the deadly to non-fatal attacks ratio, the number of fatal attacks by hour of the day, by year, and by country. \
In case you don't have a console installed, please, use an online HTML, JavaScript, and CSS compiler such as [Codepad](https://codepad.co/playground).

## 📁 [Jupyter Notebook Analysis - Python](https://github.com/nadyakant/data-project/blob/main/Shark%20Attacks(2017-2020).ipynb) 📁 

A deeper study of **Shark Attacks worldwide using Python and libraries such as Pandas, Numpy, and Matplotlib with Jupyter Notebook**. This analysis leads to important statements on shark attack fatality, frequency of occurrence by country, by year, and whether the case was provoked or not. Plan of the study:

I. Importing, Cleaning and Formatting Data

> - [x] Importing Data
> - [x] Joining 2 Data Frames
> - [x] Cleaning the data frame
> - [x] Removing errors
> - [x] Augmenting our data with additional columns
> - [x] Replacing NaN values with 0s
 
II. Vusualization and Analysis

> - [x] Fatal to Non-fatal Cases
> - [x] Calculating new values
> - [x] Provoked and unprovoked cases

## 📁 [SQL Queries](https://github.com/nadyakant/Data_Analyst_Portfolio/tree/main/SQL) 📁

> - [x] **Pet Shop Sales:**
> Here you will find meaningful **insights on pet store sales** structured as questions and answers in the form of **SQL queries**. 
> In case you don't have a console installed, please, use an online SQL compiler such as [SQLite](https://sqliteonline.com/). \

Here's how to IMPORT the .csv file with headers:

![IMPORT](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nadyakant/Data_Analyst_Portfolio/main/PNGs/Import%20csv%20to%20SQL%20Online.png)

Then, please, **copy and paste each SQL query _separately_** into the compiler, resulting in something like this:

![IMPORT](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nadyakant/Data_Analyst_Portfolio/main/PNGs/sql%20lite%20pet%20shop%20sales.png)

And most importantly... \
**Have fun calculating!**

> - [x] **Demonstration of SQL Commands:**
> This is a collection of queries **showcasing the use of commands and functions in SQL.**

## 📁 [Tableau Visualization](https://github.com/nadyakant/Data_Analyst_Portfolio/blob/main/Tableau%20-%20Shark%20Attacks%20by%20Country.md) 📁

The **[Shark Attacks by Country](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/nadya.kant/viz/SharkAttacks1900-2020/Dashboard1) dashboard** focuses on the number of accidents, whether they were provoked or unprovoked, fatal or non-fatal, the average age of people being attacked and the number of cases by year. \
By selecting a country on the responsive map, you will get results for the current region.

## 📁 [Web Scraping with Jupyter Notebooks](https://github.com/nadyakant/Data_Analyst_Portfolio/blob/main/Web%20Scraping/Web%20Scraping.ipynb)  📁 

A demonstration of using **Jupyter Notebooks and Python libraries to web scrape** and export a .csv table on [European Countries by population (2024)](https://www.worldometers.info/population/countries-in-europe-by-population/). \
The visual below represents both the notebook and the exported file:
