# Welcome to my Data Portfolio

Here you'll be able to discover example SQL queries, Excel dashboards and Tableau Visualizations united by the topic of Marine life, so have a seat and give me –∞ minute to upload some more content. Thanks!

Let's start simple...
## üë®‚Äçüíª About Me
¬°Hola! My name is Nadya and I am
a Data Analyst with an artistic twist. My background in Design and KPI-based SoMe strategies brings a creative perspective to the world of Analysis and Data Visualization. My greatest passion is uncovering meaningful insights and using data-driven approaches to level up business growth. My second greatest passion is Ocean life.

## Excel Dashboard

This Dashboard explores data on shark attacks around the world between 1919 and 2020, including fatality rate, sum of cases by year, type of attack and frequency of occurance. It is based on Brenda Griffith's [Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/global-shark-attack-incidents?select=GSAF5.xls.csv) on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/).

## HTML and JavaScript Dashboard

This Visualization dives a little into the fatal cases of shark attacks around the world, including the fatal to non-fatal attacks ratio, number of fatal attacks by hour of the day, by year and by country.

## Jupyter Notebook Analysis - Python

A deeper study of Shark Attacks around the world using Python, Pandas, Numpy and Matplotlib with Jupyter Notebook. This analysis leads to important statements on shark attack fatality, frequency of occurance by country, by year and whether the case was provoked or not. Plan of the study:

I. Importing, Cleaning and Formatting Data

- Importing Data
- Joining 2 Data Frames
- Cleaning the data frame
- Augmenting our data with additional columns
- Replacing NaN values with 0s
 
II. Vusualization and Analysis

- Fatal to Non-fatal Cases
- Calculating new values
- Provoked and unprovoked cases
- Provoked and unprovoked cases
